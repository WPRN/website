## Purpose
The World Pandemic Research Network (WPRN) is a platform serving research communities. It maintains a searchable global directory of the scientific resources available on the societal and human impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic. It shows who works on what, where, in real time, at global level.

Designed and maintained by researchers, WPRN is free, non-profit, public-funded, open (creative commons, open-source), GDPR compliant. It is steered by an international Advisory Board and supported by major scientific institutions and scientific networks worldwide.

WPRN is the product of a collective scientific intelligence, with validation by senior scholars who act as referents in their fields.

Register your project on the WPRN platform to get a time-stamped ID that will facilitate scientific collaboration and citation, even before publication.
